# CAP error messages
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# We have to explicitly copy over CAP error messages to allow translating, omitting, and changing them.
# For now, we only copy over texts that are explicitly required by our UI, all other texts are omitted for now.
#
# The messages were taken from https://github.wdf.sap.corp/cds-java/cds-services/blob/rel/1.18.2/cds-services-utils/src/main/java/com/sap/cds/services/utils/CdsErrorStatuses.java
# RegEx to convert CdsErrorStatuses.java to this format: /^\W([^0-9]*)\(([0-9]*), "(.*?)".*$/ -> /\n#XMSG: CAP error message $1 thrown in an unclear context\n$2=$3/
#
# Updates of the CAP messages should be done after switching to new versions of cds-services (do not forget to also update the GitHub file reference mentioned above).
# Additional CAP messages should be added as required.
#
# Changes to messages:
#  - Single quotes have been escaped to conform with the property file format (e.g. can't => can''t)
#  - Variable placeholders have been replaced to conform with the property file format (e.g. {}{} => {0}{1})
#  - Single quotes around variable placeholders have been replaced with double quotes (e.g. '{0}' => "{0}"")
#  - EXCEEDED_FIELD_LENGTH(400019): Rephrasing
#  - ENTITY_INSTANCE_NOT_FOUND(404009): Do not expose technical identifiers
#  - VALUE_REQUIRED(409003): Do not expose technical field names
